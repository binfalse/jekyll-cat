# CAT for Jekyll

This is a plugin for [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) that just behaves like the [`cat` tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_%28Unix%29) that you know from Unix- and Linux-based systems.

It will output a specified file into the position from where it was called from.
Quite similar to the `include` command, but it is able to include files from directories other than `_include`.


## Usage

You just need to specify the file to "cat" into the document:

    {% cat file/to/include.ext %}

This will include the contents of the file `file/to/include.ext`.
The path to the file should start relatively from Jekyll's main directory.
This, for example, goes well for code-highlighting of complete source code files.
You can just include your source file like this:

    {% highlight php %}
    {% cat assets/scripts/tool.php %}
    {% endhighlight %}


## Installation

Basically, all you need to do is putting the [file `_plugins/cat.rb`](_plugins/cat.rb) into the `_plugins` directory of your jekyll site.
For example, using wget from the root of your Jekyll website:

    wget -O _plugins/cat.rb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binfalse/jekyll-cat/master/_plugins/cat.rb

### As a Git submodule

You can of course also add this repository as a submodule to you're website if you're using git anyways:

    git submodule add https://github.com/binfalse/jekyll-cat _plugins/cat

This way it's easy to stay up-to-date with changes and bug fixes.
However, don't forget to initialise the submodules when changing machines etc:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
